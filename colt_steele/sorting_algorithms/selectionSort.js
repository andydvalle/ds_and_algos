/*
    SELECTION SORT: similar to Bubble Sort but instead of first placing large values into sorted position ,it places small values into sorted position

    Selection sort pseudocode:
    - Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far. 
    - compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
    - If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
    - If the "minimum" is not the value(index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
    - Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
