Sorting

What is sorting?
Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order

Examples:
- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue

Why do we need to learn this?
- Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
- There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

Elementary sorting algorithms:
- Bubble
- Insertion
- Selection

Move advanced:
- Merge
- Quick
- Radix
- Shell
- Heap

Built-In JavaScript Method:
- but it doesn't behave as expected
- the default sort order is according to string Unicod code points
- Accepts an optional comparator function to tell how you want it to sort
- The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
    - If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
    - If it returns a positive number, a should come after b, 
    - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
