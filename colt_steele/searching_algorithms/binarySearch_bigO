Binary Search overview:
- is much faster form of search
- rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elemtns at a time
- needs to an ordered array
- divide and conquer

Binary Search time complexity

Best Case: O(1)
Worst and average case: O(log n)
- to add an extra "step" you could double the amount of indexes
- very fast, second to O(1)
